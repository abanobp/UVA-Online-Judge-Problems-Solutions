# UVA-Online-Judge-Problems-Solutions

This repo contains some of my solutions by **C++** of UVA problems, the repo divided to some folders that are depend on the chapters of **Competitive Programming V.3 book**, each folder contains the solutions of the most **stars** problems that are recommended by the book after each topic in this chapters and some of **non-stars** problems.

I will start working on developing the repo by adding more stars problems solutions, more chapters from the CP3 book and rearrange, editing the old files in it.

**Notes**
- The name of each solution file consist of two parts, the first part is the problem ID in UVA and the second part is the problem name 
(ex : 1234 - hello.cpp, 1234 => the problem ID, hello => the problem name).

- You can view or download the book by this link [Competitive Programming 3](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xt4xqWMCOWClqc5awZ22STq5fdxvvmsP/view?usp=sharing)
