# UVA-Online-Judge-Problems-Solutions

This rebo contains some of my solutions by **C++** of UVA problems, the repo divided to some folders that are depend on the chapters of **Competitive Programming V.3 book**, each folder contains the solutions of the most **stars** problems that are recommended by the book after each topic in this chapters and some of **non-stars** problems.

I will start working on developing the rebo by adding more stars problems solutions, more chapters from the CP3 book and rearrange, editing the old files in it.
